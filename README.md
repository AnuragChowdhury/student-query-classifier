# student-query-classifier
The Student Email Query Classifier uses NLP to auto-categorize emails into Admissions, Exams, Hostel, Fees, Technical, or General queries, giving a predicted category with confidence and optionally forwarding it. A Python prototype with scikit-learn or Hugging Face, trained on past emails, saves staff time.
